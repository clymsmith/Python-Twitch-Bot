# Python-Twitch-Bot
Adapted script created by http://www.twitch.tv/ocgineer for OBS Chatbot. Made for: https://www.twitch.tv/pixipui
* I implemented the functionality to save a username &amp; date to users.json when a user in the Streamers chat types a specific string (defined by settings.json).
* Command and response from the bot is controlled by a settings.json file easily changed by Streamer.
* When user types !first command the bot responds with a custom message defined in the settings.json
